# XRF Proxy Relevance Report for Pebas Formation Sediments

## Miocene Western Amazonian Paleoenvironmental Context

**Report Date:** January 2026
**Project:** Pebas-XRF Core Scanner Analysis
**Context:** Middle-Late Miocene (c. 17-10 Ma) lacustrine-wetland sediments from the Pebas Mega-Wetland System

---

## 1. Paleoenvironmental Setting

The Pebas Formation represents a unique and complex freshwater to paralic paleoenvironment characterized by:

- **Predominantly freshwater conditions** - Sr isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr: 0.7081-0.7085) from molluscs indicate dominantly Andean-sourced freshwater drainage
- **Occasional oligohaline episodes** - Limited marine incursions during Middle to Late Miocene (c. 11-12 Ma) with maximum salinities ~5 psu
- **Tropical humid climate** - Intense chemical weathering in catchment with kaolinite/gibbsite-dominated clay assemblages
- **Lake/wetland mosaic** - Shallow lakes, fluvial channels, swamps, and lowland forests covering >1 million km2

## 2. Element Detectability with Itrax Mo Tube

### Optimal Detection (Mo tube at 60 kV, 30 mA)

| Element | Atomic # | Response | Detection Quality | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Fe** | 26 | Excellent | Primary strength of Mo tube | Most reliable major element |
| **Ti** | 22 | Very Good | ~40,000 cps typical | Excellent normalizer |
| **K** | 19 | Good | ~40,000 cps typical | Well above sensitivity threshold |
| **Ca** | 20 | Very Good | High response | Reliable for carbonate tracking |
| **Mn** | 25 | Good | Moderate | Adequate for redox proxies |
| **Rb** | 37 | Very Good | High atomic number advantage | Excellent with Mo tube |
| **Sr** | 38 | Very Good | High atomic number advantage | Excellent with Mo tube |
| **Zr** | 40 | Very Good | High atomic number advantage | Excellent with Mo tube |
| **Ba** | 56 | Good | Moderate | Adequate signal |

### Marginal Detection (Mo tube limitations)

| Element | Atomic # | Detection Quality | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Al** | 13 | Marginal | Only reliable >22,000 ppm (2.2%); Cr tube preferred |
| **Si** | 14 | Marginal | Better with Cr tube; air/He atmosphere matters |
| **P** | 15 | Poor | Very low sensitivity with Mo tube |
| **S** | 16 | Poor | Unreliable quantification |

### Implications for Proxy Selection

- **Preferred proxies:** Those using Fe, Ti, K, Ca, Mn, Rb, Sr, Zr as primary components
- **Caution required:** Proxies heavily dependent on Al, Si detection (e.g., Si/Al, CIA)
- **Not recommended:** P-based productivity proxies (P/Ti) without independent validation

## 3. Proxy Evaluation: Currently Used Ratios

### 3.1 Ca/Ti - RECOMMENDED (with caveats)

**Current interpretation:** Carbonate (biogenic/authigenic) vs detrital input

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** HIGH

**Mechanism:**
- Higher Ca/Ti indicates increased carbonate precipitation or reduced clastic input
- In freshwater Pebas lakes, authigenic carbonate (aragonite needles, ostracod shells) precipitates during warmer/drier periods with increased evaporation
- Low Ca/Ti indicates terrigenous dominance during wetter periods with enhanced runoff

**Caveats for Pebas:**
- Distinguish between authigenic vs detrital carbonate
- Oligohaline incursion events may introduce marine carbonate signals
- Sr/Ca ratios can help discriminate aragonite (high Sr) vs calcite (low Sr)

**Detection:** Excellent - both Ca and Ti well-detected by Mo tube

---

### 3.2 Fe/Mn - CONDITIONAL USE

**Current interpretation:** Redox indicator at sediment-water interface

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** MODERATE (with significant limitations)

**Mechanism:**
- Under reducing (anoxic) conditions, Mn2+ is more soluble than Fe2+ and diffuses upward
- Higher Fe/Mn theoretically indicates more reducing bottom water conditions

**CRITICAL LIMITATIONS for Pebas:**

1. **Detrital Fe interference:** Variable detrital Fe input from Andean sources obscures redox signal
2. **Tropical weathering effects:** Lateritic soils in catchment have highly elevated Fe/Al ratios
3. **Diagenetic trapping:** Under permanent anoxia, Mn is trapped as carbonates/oxides, inverting the expected relationship
4. **Lake-specific calibration required:** Fe/Mn interpretation varies between individual lake basins

**Recommendation:** Use with caution; combine with independent redox indicators (e.g., S enrichment, organic carbon preservation). Do not over-interpret small variations.

---

### 3.3 K/Ti - LIMITED RELEVANCE

**Current interpretation:** Clay composition, weathering intensity

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** LOW

**Major Problems:**

1. **Already intensely weathered catchment:** Miocene tropical Amazonia had CIA values of 80-100, meaning K-bearing minerals were already largely depleted in source areas
2. **Kaolinite dominance:** Mature tropical soils produce kaolinite (K-free) rather than illite (K-bearing)
3. **Signal saturation:** When chemical weathering is already intense, K/Ti shows minimal dynamic range
4. **Provenance effects:** K/Ti variations may reflect sediment source changes rather than weathering intensity

**Recommendation:** REMOVE or use only to identify unusual K-enriched layers (possible volcanic ash, feldspar-rich inputs)

**Reference:** [Chemical weathering of crystalline rocks in contrasting climatic conditions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018220303187)

---

### 3.4 Rb/Sr - LIMITED RELEVANCE

**Current interpretation:** Silicate weathering intensity

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** LOW to MODERATE

**Problems:**

1. **Timescale dependency:** Rb/Sr is more sensitive to long-term (glacial-interglacial) weathering changes than Miocene tropical conditions with continuously high weathering
2. **Sr behavior in carbonates:** Sr substitutes readily into aragonite; in carbonate-rich Pebas sediments, Sr reflects carbonate chemistry more than silicate weathering
3. **Physical vs chemical weathering:** In high-runoff tropical settings, physical sediment transport may dominate over chemical weathering signals
4. **Grain size effects:** Hydrodynamic sorting affects Rb/Sr independently of weathering

**Alternative Interpretation:** In Pebas context, low Rb/Sr may indicate:
- Carbonate-rich intervals (Sr enrichment from aragonite)
- Marine/brackish incursion events (higher Sr)

**Recommendation:** Interpret as carbonate/salinity indicator rather than weathering proxy

---

### 3.5 Zr/Rb - CONDITIONAL USE

**Current interpretation:** Grain size proxy (coarse vs fine fraction)

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** MODERATE

**Mechanism:**
- Zr concentrates in heavy minerals (zircon) in coarse fraction
- Rb concentrates in clay minerals in fine fraction
- Higher Zr/Rb indicates higher energy depositional conditions

**Advantages:**
- Both elements well-detected by Mo tube
- Insensitive to redox and diagenetic effects
- Good correlation with measured grain size in many settings

**Limitations for Pebas:**
1. **Provenance effects:** Multiple sediment sources (Andean, shield) with different Zr/Rb signatures
2. **Heavy mineral concentration:** Zr can reflect placer-like concentration rather than overall grain size
3. **Log transformation recommended:** Use ln(Zr/Rb) to improve linearity

**Recommendation:** Retain as hydrodynamic energy proxy; acknowledge provenance complications

**Reference:** [Evaluating Zr/Rb Ratio as Grain-Size Indicator](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GC009350)

---

### 3.6 Si/Al - NOT RECOMMENDED

**Current interpretation:** Quartz (coarse) vs clay (fine) content

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** LOW

**Critical Problems:**
1. **Poor Al detection:** Mo tube unreliable for Al at typical sediment concentrations
2. **Poor Si detection:** Mo tube not optimal for light elements
3. **Better alternatives exist:** Zr/Rb provides equivalent grain size information with better detection

**Recommendation:** REMOVE - use Zr/Rb instead

---

### 3.7 Ba/Ti - LIMITED RELEVANCE

**Current interpretation:** Paleoproductivity (Ba scavenged by organic particles)

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** LOW

**Problems:**
1. **Marine-centric proxy:** Ba/Ti productivity proxy developed for marine settings where barite precipitation occurs
2. **Freshwater limitations:** In freshwater lakes, Ba behavior differs; may reflect salinity changes (BaSO4 precipitates at higher salinity)
3. **Diagenetic mobility:** Under sulfate-reducing conditions, barite dissolves

**Alternative Interpretation for Pebas:**
- Ba enrichment during oligohaline incursion events (elevated sulfate enables barite precipitation)
- High Ba may indicate brackish rather than productive conditions

**Recommendation:** Retain but reinterpret as potential salinity indicator rather than productivity proxy

---

### 3.8 Si/Ti - CONDITIONAL USE

**Current interpretation:** Biogenic silica (diatoms) vs detrital silica

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** MODERATE

**Mechanism:**
- In lacustrine settings, elevated Si/Ti may indicate diatom productivity
- Diatoms can be abundant in shallow Amazonian lakes

**Limitations:**
1. **Si detection issues:** Mo tube not optimal for Si
2. **Detrital silica dominance:** Quartz-rich Andean sediments may overwhelm biogenic signal
3. **Need independent verification:** Diatom abundance should be confirmed microscopically

**Recommendation:** Retain with caveats; useful only if biogenic silica is significant component

---

### 3.9 Fe/Ti - RECOMMENDED

**Current interpretation:** Fe-bearing minerals relative to Ti (detrital composition)

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** HIGH

**Mechanism:**
- Tracks variations in Fe-bearing detrital minerals (oxides, hydroxides, clays)
- In tropical settings, reflects intensity of lateritic weathering in catchment
- Higher Fe/Ti may indicate enhanced runoff transporting weathered material

**Advantages:**
- Both elements excellently detected by Mo tube
- Less affected by redox complications than Fe/Mn
- Good indicator of terrigenous sediment character

**Recommendation:** Retain - robust detrital composition indicator

---

### 3.10 K/Rb - LIMITED USE

**Current interpretation:** Potassium feldspar vs clay

**Relevance to Pebas Formation:** LOW

**Problem:** In intensely weathered tropical settings, both K and Rb are depleted together; ratio shows limited diagnostic value.

**Recommendation:** REMOVE or use only for identifying unusual feldspar-rich layers

---

## 4. ADDITIONAL PROXIES TO CONSIDER

### 4.1 Ti/Al - Detrital Flux Proxy (if Al detectable)

**Mechanism:** Ti/Al tracks heavy mineral concentration in detrital input

**Relevance:** Could identify changes in sediment provenance (Andean vs cratonic sources)

**Caveat:** Requires adequate Al detection; may need longer dwell times

---

### 4.2 Sr/Ca - Carbonate Mineralogy/Salinity

**Mechanism:**
- Aragonite has higher Sr/Ca than calcite
- Marine/brackish carbonates have higher Sr/Ca than freshwater

**Relevance to Pebas:** HIGH - could discriminate:
- Freshwater authigenic carbonate (low Sr/Ca calcite)
- Brackish/incursion-related carbonate (higher Sr/Ca aragonite)
- Ostracod shell vs bulk carbonate composition

**Recommendation:** ADD this proxy

---

### 4.3 CIA - Chemical Index of Alteration (calculated)

**Formula:** CIA = [Al2O3 / (Al2O3 + CaO* + Na2O + K2O)] x 100

**Mechanism:**
- Measures feldspar to clay mineral conversion
- Values 80-100 indicate intense tropical weathering

**Relevance to Pebas:** MODERATE

**Caveats:**
- Requires reliable Al detection (problematic with Mo tube)
- CaO* correction needed for carbonate-bound Ca
- K2O correction for diagenetic illitization

**Recommendation:** Calculate where possible; acknowledge detection limitations

**Reference:** [Chemical Index of Alteration - Nesbitt & Young](https://chemostratigraphy.com/chemical-index-of-alteration-nesbitt-young-1982/)

---

### 4.4 Mn/Ca - Redox-Carbonate Coupling

**Mechanism:**
- Mn can substitute into carbonates under reducing conditions
- Mn/Ca in carbonate-rich intervals may indicate bottom-water oxygenation

**Relevance:** Potentially useful for understanding redox conditions during carbonate precipitation events

**Recommendation:** CONSIDER adding; may be more diagnostic than Fe/Mn in this setting

---

### 4.5 Inc/Coh (Mo scattering ratio) - Matrix Correction

**Current status:** Already calculated (inc_coh)

**Mechanism:**
- Ratio of incoherent (Compton) to coherent (Rayleigh) X-ray scattering
- Related to average atomic number of sample matrix
- Higher values indicate lighter matrix (more organic matter, water)

**Relevance to Pebas:** MODERATE - may track organic-rich vs mineral-rich intervals

**Recommendation:** Retain for matrix correction and organic matter indicator

---
